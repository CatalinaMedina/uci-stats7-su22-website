**Question 1**  
What percent of a standard normal distribution, $N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1)$, is found in each region? For each: 

- sketch the distribution (i.e. draw the normal curve centered at the mean) and indicate what area we are looking for
- write out the `R` code you used to calculate the area
- calculate the percentage of the distribution that lies in that region

**(a)** Z > -1.13  

*(a) Solution:*

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", include = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("hw2-question1-curve1.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
1 - pnorm(-1.13, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

87.08% of the area in a standard normal curve is above Z = -1.13.



**(b)** Z < 0.18

*(b) Solution:*

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", include = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("hw2-question1-curve2.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pnorm(0.18, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

57.14% of the area in a standard normal curve is below Z = 0.18.

**(c)** Z > 8

*(c) Solution:*

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", include = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("hw2-question1-curve3.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
1 - pnorm(8, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Approximately 0% of the area in a standard normal curve is above Z = 8.

**(d)** |Z| < 0.5

*(d) Solution:*

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", include = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("hw2-question1-curve4.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pnorm(0.5, mean = 0, sd = 1) - pnorm(-0.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Approximately 38.29% of the area in a standard normal curve is between -0.15 and 0.15.


**Question 2**

The distribution of passenger vehicle speeds traveling on the Interstate 5 Freeway (I-5) in California is nearly normal with a mean of 72.6 miles/hour and a standard deviation of 4.78 miles/hour.

**(a)** What percent of passenger vehicles travel slower than 80 miles/hour?

*(a) Solution:*

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", include = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("hw2-question3-curve1.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pnorm(80, mean = 72.6, sd = 4.78)
```

93.92% of passenger vehicles travel slower than 80 miles/hour on the I-5.

**(b)** What percent of passenger vehicles travel between 60 and 80 miles/hour?

*(b) Solution:*

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", include = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("hw2-question3-curve2.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pnorm(80, mean = 72.6, sd = 4.78) - pnorm(60, mean = 72.6, sd = 4.78)
```

93.50% of passenger vehicles travel between 60 and 80 miles/hour on the I-5.

**(c)** How fast do the fastest 5% of passenger vehicles travel?

*(c) Solution:*

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", include = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("hw2-question3-curve3.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qnorm(1 - 0.05, mean = 72.6, sd = 4.78)
```

The fastest 5% of passenger vehicles on the I-5 travels 80.46 miles/hour or more.

**(d)** The speed limit on this stretch of the I-5 is 70 miles/hour. Approximate what percentage of the passenger
vehicles travel above the speed limit on this stretch of the I-5.

*(d) Solution:*

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", include = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("hw2-question3-curve4.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
1 - pnorm(70, mean = 72.6, sd = 4.78)
```

70.68% of passenger vehicles travel above the speed limit of 70 miles/hour on this stretch of the I-5.


**Question 3**

Heights of 10 year olds, regardless of gender, closely follow a normal distribution with mean 55 inches and standard deviation 6 inches. The height requirement for Batman the Ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain is 54 inches. 

**(a)** What percent of 10 year olds cannot go on this ride?

*(a) Solution:*

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", include = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("hw2-question4-curve1.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pnorm(54, mean = 55, sd = 6)
```

43.38% of 10 year olds cannot go on this ride because they are shorter than 54 inches.

**(b)** Say engineers were thinking of putting a limit on the maximum height of a passenger. If the limit was 6 feet (72 inches), what percent of 10 year olds would not be able to ride?

*(b) Solution:*

```{r, echo = FALSE,out.width = "0.3\\linewidth", include = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("hw2-question4-curve2.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pnorm(72, mean = 55, sd = 6) - pnorm(54, mean = 55, sd = 6)
```

56.39% of 10 year olds cannot go on this ride because they are shorter than 54 inches or taller than 72 inches.


**Question 4**

For each of the following situations, state whether the parameter of interest is a mean or a proportion.

**(a)** A poll shows that 64% of Americans personally worry a great deal about federal spending and the budget
deficit.

*(a) Solution:*

Whether or not they worry about federal spending is a categorical variable with two levels, so this is looking at the proportion.

**(b)** A survey reports that local TV news has shown a 17% increase in revenue within a two year period
while newspaper revenues decreased by 6.4% during this time period.

*(b) Solution:*

The percent change in revenue is a numerical value so we would be looking at the mean.

**(c)** In a survey, high school and college students are asked whether or not they use geolocation services on
their phones.

*(c) Solution:*

Whether or not they use geolocation services on their phone is a categorical variable so we would be looking at proportion.

**(d)** In a survey, smart phone users are asked whether or not they use a web-based taxi service.

*(d) Solution:*

Whether or not they use a web-based taxi service is a categorical variable so we would be looking at proportion.

**(e)** In a survey, smart phone users are asked how many times they used a web-based taxi service over the
last year.

*(e) Solution:*

The number of times used is a discrete numerical variable so we would look at the mean number of times used.


**Question 5**

In a random sample 765 adults in the United States, 322 say they could not cover a $400 unexpected expense without borrowing money or going into debt.

**(a)** What population is under consideration in the data set?

*(a) Solution:*

Here we are considering adults in the United States.

**(b)** What parameter is being estimated?

*(b) Solution:*

We want to estimate the proportion of US adults who could not cover a $400 unexpected expense without borrowing money or going into debt.

**(c)** What is the point estimate for the parameter?

*(c) Solution:*

The point estimate is the sample proportion.

**(d)** What is the name of the statistic we use to measure the uncertainty of the point estimate?

*(d) Solution:*

The uncertainty of a point estimate is the standard error.

**(e)** Compute the value from part (d) for this context.

*(e) Solution:*

The standard error is computed as:
$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{(322/765)(1 - 322/765)}{765}}$$

```{r}
sqrt((322 / 765) * (1 - 322 / 765) / 765)
```

The standard error of our point estimate is 0.0178.

**(f)** A cable news pundit thinks the value is actually 50%. Should she be surprised by the data?

*(f) Solution:*

```{r}
(322 / 765) + 0.0178
```

Yes she should be surprised because 50% is more than 2 standard deviations above the sample proportion (this is called the rule of thumb).


**(g)** Suppose the true population value was found to be 40%. If we use this proportion to recompute the
value in part (e) using p = 0.4 instead of $\hat{p}$, does the resulting value change much?

*(g) Solution:*

The standard error would be computed as:
$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.4 (1 - 0.4)}{765}}$$

```{r}
sqrt(0.4 * (1 - 0.4) / 765)
```

The standard deviation with p = 0.4, 0.0177, is very close to that for the sample proportion, 0.0178. 


**Question 6**

Of all freshman at a large college, 16% made the deanâ€™s list in the current year. As part of a class project, students randomly sample 40 students and check if those students made the list. They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.

**(a)** What is this distribution called?

*(a) Solution:*

The distribution is called the sampling distribution.

**(b)** Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric or skewed? Explain your reasoning.

*(b) Solution:*

```{r}
40 * .16
```

np equals 6.4 which does not meet the success failure requirement of 10 or more, so the Central Limit Theorem does not apply and so I would expect the distribution to be skewed. 

**(c)** Calculate the variability of this distribution.

*(c) Solution:*

The standard error is computed as:
$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.16 (1 - 0.16)}{40}}$$

```{r}
sqrt(0.16 * (1 - 0.16) / 40)
```

The standard error of our point estimate is 0.0580.

**(d)** Suppose the students decide to sample again, this time collecting 90 students per sample, and they again
collect 1,000 samples. They build a new distribution of sample proportions. How will the variability
of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 40
observations?

*(d) Solution:*

The increased the sample size so the new sampling distribution should be closer to a normal distribution than the original sampling distribution.


**Question 7**

A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter. The standard error for this estimate was 2.4%, and a normal distribution may be used to model the sample proportion. Construct a 99% confidence interval for the fraction of U.S. adult Twitter users who get some news on Twitter, and interpret the confidence interval in context.

*Solution:*

We are told the distribution is approximately normal so we calculate the confidence interval as
$$\hat{p} \pm Z^* \times SE$$

We need to find $Z^*$ for 99% confidence level so we use `qnorm()`.

```{r}
qnorm((1 - 0.99) / 2, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Now we know our $\hat{p}$ is 0.52, $Z^*$ is 2.58, and SE is 0.024. 

```{r}
0.52 - 2.57 * 0.024
```
```{r}
0.52 + 2.57 * 0.024
```

We are 99% confident that the proportion of U.S. adult Twitter users that get at least some news on Twitter is between 0.4583 and 0.5817.


**Question 8**

A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter, and the standard error for this estimate was 2.4%. Identify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.

**(a)** Since the standard error is 2.4%, we can conclude that 97.6% of all U.S. adult Twitter users were
included in the study.

*(a) Solution:*

False, the standard error is the uncertainty of our sample proportion in estimating the population proportion.

**(b)** If we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate, we should collect less data.

*(b) Solution:*

False, decreasing our sample size will increase the standard error.

**(c)** If we construct a 90% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. adults Twitter users who get
some news through Twitter, this confidence interval will be wider than a corresponding 99% confidence
interval.

*(c) Solution:*

False, as the confidence level increases our confidence interval gets wider.


**Question 9**
A store randomly samples 603 shoppers over the course of a year and finds that 142 of them made their visit because of a coupon theyâ€™d received in the mail. 

**(a)** Construct a 95% confidence interval for the fraction of all shoppers during the year whose visit was because of a coupon theyâ€™d received in the mail. Remember to check the conditions required to use a normal distribution for our point estimate.

*(a) Solution:*

First we need to check the conditions of independence and the success failure requirement. This is a random sample so we have independence. $np = 603 * (142 / 603) = 142 \geq 10$ and $n(1-p) = 603 * (1 - 142 / 603) = 461$. Thus both conditions are met so the CLT says the point estimate will be approximately normally distributed.

Now we need to identify the components of our confidence interval. $\hat{p} = 142/603$, $Z^*$ = 1.96, and $SE \approx \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$.

```{r}
142 / 603 - 1.96 * sqrt((142 / 603) * (1 - 142 / 603) / 603)
```

```{r}
142 / 603 + 1.96 * sqrt((142 / 603) * (1 - 142 / 603) / 603)
```

We are 95% confident that the proportion of shoppers in a year that made their visit because of a coupon they'd received in the mail is between 0.2016 and 0.2694.

**(b)** What does "95% confident" mean? Explain in the context of the application.

*(b) Solution:*
It means that 95% of samples collected from this population would have confidence intervals that contain the true proportion of yearly shoppers that visited because of a coupon they'd received in the mail.
